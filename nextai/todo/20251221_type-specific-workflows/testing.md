### Session 1 - 12/22/2025, 11:03 AM
**Status:** FAIL
**Notes:** 1) Remove LEGACY_WORKFLOW_CUTOFF_DATE entirely - apply new type-specific workflows immediately to ALL features (no legacy mode). 2) Add integration tests for type-specific transitions (recommendation #1). 3) Add metrics tracking for validation bypass rates per type (recommendation #3). 4) For any issues with existing features, use repair command or move to created phase to restart flow.
